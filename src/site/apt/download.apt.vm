Project Archive and JAR

The latest JAR can be obtained from the Codehaus Maven repository.  The
repository also contains project assemblies (.tar.gz), which include the
source code, generated JavaDoc, and dependency JARs.  <
<The latest release is
     version ${project-version}.>>

{{{http://snapshots.repository.codehaus.org/org/codehaus/groovy/modules/http-builder/http-builder/}
Browse the latest snapshot here.}}

{{{http://repository.codehaus.org/org/codehaus/groovy/modules/http-builder/http-builder/}
Browse the latest stable build here.}}

Older releases may also be found under the
{{{http://repository.codehaus.org/org/codehaus/groovy/http-builder/}old group ID.}}

Maven Users

Maven users can simply copy the dependency tag into their own project:

%{code-snippet|id=download1|brush=xml|file=src/site/examples.txt}

You might also need to add the Codehaus repository to your project POM as well:

%{code-snippet|id=download2|brush=xml|file=src/site/examples.txt}


Using Grape

{{{http://groovy.codehaus.org/Grape}Grape}} is a neat dependency management
feature in Groovy 1.6+ that allows you to download and add JARs to your classpath at runtime.

You can automatically put HTTPBuilder in your classpath by using the following
annotation on a method in your code:

%{code-snippet|id=download3|brush=groovy|file=src/site/examples.txt}

Note that in Groovy 1.6, the <<<@Grab>>> annotation must occur on a method
definition (it can be an empty method.) Putting the annotation before a
statement such as a variable declaration will not work.  This is a common
error and Grape will not provide any indication that it is not augmenting
the runtime classpath.  This should change in Groovy 1.7.

If you are still having problems, try calling <<
<grape>>> from the command
    line like so:

    ----------------------------------------
    $ grape resolve org.codehaus.groovy.modules.http-builder http-builder ${project-version}
    # will tell you where grape is looking and give detailed config information


    $ grape install org.codehaus.groovy.modules.http-builder http-builder ${project-version}
    # will attempt to download the JAR and transitive dependencies
    ----------------------------------------

    The above commands will tell you which repository URLs grape is trying to download
    from if it cannot find the artifact.

    If you are trying to use a snapshot version of HTTPBuilder, you might also
    need to create the following file in <<<~/.groovy/grapeConfig.xml>>>:

    %{code-snippet|id=download4|brush=xml|file=src/site/examples.txt}

    Note the
    <codehaus.snapshots> line, which tells Grape where HTTPBuilder's
        snapshot builds are located, since that repository is not searched by default.
