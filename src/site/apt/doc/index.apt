Introduction
  
  HTTPBuilder is optimized for three tasks:
  
  [[]]  Streaming response handling,
  
  [[]]  Automatic response parsing based on content-type
   
  [[]]  Sucess & failure handling based on the response status code
  
  []
  
  To achieve this, HTTPBuilder exposes convenience methods for common request types,
  (i.e. GET and POST) and a more complex <<<request>>> method that allows fine-grained
  configuration of each request and response.
  
  The following example shows most of the <<<request>>> method's features. 
  
%{code-snippet|id=doc1|brush=groovy|file=src/site/examples.txt}

  
  If you are familiar with the HTTP protocol, most of the above should be 
  self-explanatory.  The 
  <<<{{{../apidocs/groovyx/net/http/HTTPBuilder.html#request(groovyx.net.http.Method,%20java.lang.Object,%20groovy.lang.Closure)}request()}}>>>
   method accepts three parameters: a <method>, 
  <content-type>, and a <request configuration closure>.  Within the 
  configuration closure, we can fine-tune the parameters for this request, 
  including manipulating portions of the URL, and adding request headers.  A 
  full list of properties that can be manipulated during request configuration
  can be found in the 
  {{{../apidocs/groovyx/net/http/HTTPBuilder.RequestConfigDelegate.html}RequestConfigDelegate}} 
  class. 
  
  The <<<req>>> parameter passed to the closure is an 
  {{{http://hc.apache.org/httpcomponents-core-ga/httpcore/apidocs/org/apache/http/message/BasicHttpRequest.html}HttpRequest}}
  instance, which can be used to configure additional aspects of the request 
  for which HTTPBuilder does not provide a wrapper. 
  
  The remaining 'response' definitions in the above example configure how the 
  response is handled based on the HTTP status code returned by the server.  In
  general, a "success" and "failure" response handler may be defined, or a 
  response handler may be defined for a specific response code.  
  
  In the simplest case, no 'failure' handler needs to be defined; the default 
  failure handler will throw an exception, which is triggered for any response
  code > 399.  You can also customize default response handlers that will be 
  in effect for all requests made by the <<<HTTPBuilder>>> instance:

The Magic: Built-in Content-Type Parsing

	HTTPBuilder is also able to intelligently handle different response 
	content-types.  In this example, the response data is automatically parsed 
	into a <<<JSON>>> object, which is then passed to the 'success' response 
	handler.

%{code-snippet|id=doc3|brush=groovy|file=src/site/examples.txt}


  You can try the above example by adding the <<<@Grab>>> macro (as demonstrated 
  on the {{{../download.html}download page}}) with Groovy 1.6. 


*Parser Resolution

  By default, new HTTPBuilder instances use <<<ContentType.ANY>>> as the initial 
  content-type.  This means every request has an <<<Accept: */*>>> header, and 
  it is up to the server to decide what appropriate content-type to return.  
  HTTPBuilder then chooses the appropriate parser from its <<<ParserRegistry>>> 
  based on the response <<<Content-Type>>> header value.
  
  <If> a <<<contentType>>> is set (either in 
  <<<HTTPBuilder.setContentType(...)>>> or as a <<<request>>> method parameter),
  HTTPBuilder will attempt to parse the response using that content-type, 
  regardless of what the server actually responds with.   The first example on
  this page actually uses that strategy to parse an HTML document as plain text
  (i.e. by creating a <<<Reader>>>) rather than detecting an HTML content-type
  and using the default HTML parsing method.  You can read more about automatic
  content-type parsing on the {{{./contentTypes.html}Content Types page}}.



{Logging and Debugging}

  Probably the quickest way to debug is to turn on logging for HTTPBuilder and 
  Apache HttpClient.  An example 
  {{{https://svn.codehaus.org/gmod/httpbuilder/trunk/src/test/resources/log4j.xml}
  log4j configuration}} can be used to output headers and request/response 
  content, as well as additional information on what HTTPBuilder is doing with 
  the request and response.
  
  To see the raw request and response output, change the Apache HttpClient
  logging parameters to <<<DEBUG>>> like so:
